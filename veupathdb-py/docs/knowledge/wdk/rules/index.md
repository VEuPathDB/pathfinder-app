# WDK rules

Each file holds one ID family. The statement in a heading is an assertion, not advice.

`class` sets test priority: `HARD` means WDK rejects the request, `SILENT` means WDK
accepts it and the science is wrong, `CONTRACT` means a PathFinder invariant that keeps
us aligned. `SILENT` is why this exists.

`WDK-SITE` is separated from `WDK-PARAM` by its falsifier rather than by its subject. A
`WDK-PARAM` rule is refuted by the WDK repository; a `WDK-SITE` rule is refuted by
ApiCommonModel, which declares the parameters WDK merely executes. The same distinction is
why [WDK-ANS-007](searches-and-answers.md) needed ApiCommonWebsite pinned.
