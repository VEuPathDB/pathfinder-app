# What this file is

VDI is a separate service from WDK. It lives at `{site_origin}/vdi` on every configured
site, and its contract is RAML, not OpenAPI: `GET /vdi/openapi.json` is 404 and `GET
/vdi/api` serves rendered HTML. This file records the part of that contract PathFinder
depends on, pinned to the source that defines it. Why PathFinder uses it this way is recorded in
`pathfinder: docs/knowledge/decisions/vdi-is-a-publish-target-not-a-store.md`.

Every citation is `VEuPathDB/vdi-service@34eb6f2f331bc5a8cd686d63588102b46d30b4dd`, under
`project/core/module/rest-service/`.

# Credentials

`AuthFilter.findAuthUser` accepts three forms and rejects everything else
(`VEuPathDB/lib-jaxrs-container-core@2d1d138aca44af36c09ed4650b256aa999a75ad6`,
`src/main/java/org/veupathdb/lib/container/jaxrs/server/middleware/AuthFilter.java`, with
the header name in `.../utils/RequestKeys.java`):

| form | measured against `GET https://plasmodb.org/vdi/datasets` |
| --- | --- |
| `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | 200 |
| `Authorization: <token>` (no scheme) | 401 |
| `Authorization` cookie | 200 |
| `?access_token=<token>` | 200 |
| `Auth-Key: <token>` | 401 |
| no credential | 401 `{"status":"unauthorized","message":"HTTP 401 Unauthorized"}` |

The token is the same non-guest WDK `Authorization` value `password_login` returns.
PathFinder sends the bearer header. `/plugins` is the only endpoint below that answers
without a credential.

# Endpoints

| method + path | request | response | RAML | PathFinder |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /datasets` | `multipart/form-data`: `details` (JSON `DatasetPostMeta`) and `dataFile` (one text file, one gene id per line) | 202 + `Location`, body `{"datasetId": "<VdiId>"}` | `api-schema/resources/dataset-list/method-post.raml`, `api-schema/types/by-path/datasets/post.raml` | `VdiClient.create_genelist` |
| `GET /datasets/{vdi-id}` | none | 200 `DatasetDetails`; 404 deleted; 410 gone; 425 not yet in the object store | `api-schema/resources/dataset/method-get.raml`, `.../types/by-path/datasets/vdi-id/get.raml` | `VdiClient.get` |
| `GET /datasets` | none | 200 `DatasetListEntry[]` | `api-schema/resources/dataset-list/method-get.raml`, `.../types/by-path/datasets/get.raml` | not called; the row keeps the one id it published |
| `DELETE /datasets/{vdi-id}` | none | 204 | `api-schema/resources/dataset/method-delete.raml` | `VdiClient.delete` |
| `PUT /datasets/{vdi-id}/shares/{recipient-user-id}/offer` | `{"action": "grant" \| "revoke"}` | 204 | `api-schema/resources/dataset-shares/resource.raml`, `.../types/by-path/datasets/vdi-id/shares/put.raml` | not called; PathFinder publishes and reads, it does not share |
| `GET /plugins` | none, no credential | 200 `PluginListItem[]` | `api-schema/resources/plugins/resource.raml` | not called; read once to pin the plugin name and its targets |

`details` carries `type: {name, version}`, `installTargets` (at least one), `name` (3 to
1024 chars), `summary` (3 to 4000), optional `description`, `origin`, `visibility` and
`dependencies` - `api-schema/types/common.raml` `DatasetMetaBase`, `DatasetTypeInput`,
`DatasetVisibility`. PathFinder sends `origin: "direct-upload"` and one install target,
the site's own `project_id`, which is what the site's native export does
(`VEuPathDB/web-monorepo@905ce53ffd0213c9a1da4f6b6f9873768193f2d5`,
`packages/sites/genomics-site/webapp/wdkCustomization/js/client/components/records/gene-list-export-utils.tsx:366-382`).

`VdiId` is `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$` (`common.raml`), which is why it can never be a WDK
`DatasetParam` value.

# The three status axes

`DatasetStatusInfo` (`common.raml`) reports `upload`, `import` and one `install` entry per
target. They move independently, and the enum members are:

- upload: `running`, `success`, `rejected`, `failed`
- import: `queued`, `in-progress`, `complete`, `invalid`, `failed`
- install: `queued`, `running`, `complete`, `failed-validation`, `failed-installation`,
  `ready-for-reinstall`, `missing-dependency`

An `install` array is absent until import completes. The wire spells the import axis
`import`, which is a Python keyword, so the client's field is `import_` with a
`validation_alias`.

# The genelist plugin

`GET https://plasmodb.org/vdi/plugins` lists `genelist` v1.0, category `Gene List`,
`maxFileSize` 1073741824, `allowedFileExtensions` `[".txt", ".csv", ".tsv"]`, and 13
install targets: AmoebaDB, CryptoDB, FungiDB, GiardiaDB, HostDB, MicrosporidiaDB,
PiroplasmaDB, PlasmoDB, ToxoDB, TrichDB, TriTrypDB, VectorBase, UniDB. The plugin's
importer splits on `[\s,;]+` and writes one id per line
(`VEuPathDB/vdi-plugin-genelist@cfb31e78a43b91f22037b1e36c7e2e4a9a17713e`,
`lib/python/eupath/GeneListDatasetImporter.py`), so PathFinder uploads one id per line.

# Measured install latency

One five-gene `genelist` published to PlasmoDB on 2026-09-04, polled every five seconds
from the 202:

| elapsed | upload | import | install |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.7 s | `success` | `queued` | absent |
| 7.6 s | `success` | `complete` | `PlasmoDB: complete` |

`DELETE` then returned 204, `GET /datasets/{id}` returned 404 `{"status":"not-found"}`,
and the account's listing returned to zero entries. No SLA, retry budget or duration
appears anywhere in `vdi-service`, so this is one measurement and not a guarantee.
